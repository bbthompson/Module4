CSS Tutorial Assignment for Module 4 of WEB210

This code is the html and css that I created following the project steps 3, 4, and 6 in the LinkedIn CSS Essential Training (https://www.linkedin.com/learning/css-essential-training-22688362) as part of my coursework at Wake Tech. This is a continuation of the Module3 assignment for the course which can be found in my Module3 GitHub Repository.
